// Zero knowldge proofs are usually based on Rust



// Structs: it is a unique data type you create

struct Person: {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
    email: String,

}  //You create new data type, so that in the future 
   //you can use it when required in the future

   fn main(){
    let mut alice = Person {name: "Arslan", age:20};

   } // the way to initialise struct


   //Vectors: Vectors give you moore flexibility that arrays
// if you see exclamation mark = it is macro
let names = vec!["Holy", "Alissa", "Arslan"];
